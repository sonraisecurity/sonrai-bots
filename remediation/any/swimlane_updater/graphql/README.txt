This file isn't necessary, but if you are using the gql_loader like this:

from sonrai import gql_loader

with your bot you need at least the graphql folder in place, even if it is blank.

If you need to have Sonrai searches in your bot you can include them in this folder to make your bot code cleaner.
To do this, create a text file that is just the Advanced GraphQL search that you would run in Sonrai.
