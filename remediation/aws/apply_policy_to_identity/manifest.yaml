# Built-in Sonrai Bot: srn:supersonrai::bot/9e6d8698-bd4e-11ea-b3de-0242ac130004
version: 2020-07-10
type: Remediation
title: Apply Recommended/Non-Logged Actions Policy to Identity
description: >-
  When the bot/escalation applies this remediation, the policy assigned to the identity is based on 2 data sets
    - the services and permissions used by the user & seen by Sonrai
    - any services & permissions they previously had access too, but are NOT logged by AWS and thus, not reported to Sonrai.
  In this scenario, the recommended policy will include both sets of services:permissions, and can result in a
  substantially larger policy configuration. You may wish to manually review the policy to determine if you want
  to make changes prior to deploying it into your cloud.
